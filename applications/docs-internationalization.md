# VeChain General Grant Application Template

## Project Overview

- Project: Documentation Internationalization and Translation to Portuguese
- Team Name: Renan
- Payment Address: 0x88b3F403B5fEef8D3a84F77791387a4f36b0A328

### Overview

The VeChain documentation provides valuable information for developers to excel in utilizing, developing, expanding the ecosystem. Though the English language is widely and globaly accepted among developers, there is value in providing translation to other languages. Providing alternative languages can both create exposure to the VeChain tools to non-english speaking countries, as well as increase information accessibility from those countries.

The goal of this project is to modify the documentation structure to allow multiple languages to be easily added, as well as translate the existing documentation to Portuguese. Portuguese speaking countries, such as Brazil, concentrate a strong developer community, and providing Portuguese translation can expand VeChain's awareness in those countries.

### Project Details

Project consists in making changes to the documetation's VuePress set up to allow for new languages to be added, and then necessary text and markup changes of the existing documentation to Portuguese.
