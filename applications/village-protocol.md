# VeChain General Grant Application Template

## Project Overview 

- Project: Village Protocal
- Team Name: Digital Village
- Payment Address: 0x919C763d692DB41833b4CE0879DF980Ce50D9C1C

### Overview

<br />

Today, companies are using blockchain to build trust and transparency. How they present their data and claims to the consumers lack proof. Proving a claim to consumers would require technical literacy to read blockchain data. Village Protocol is an interface to show their blockchain data in a way consumers understand easily.
<br />
Village Protocol focuses on decentralizing data instead of monetizing user interactions. Account information is stored on the Vechain blockchain, and data is stored on IPFS with a link to it on the Vechain. The permanence of storing posts/comments on a blockchain is treated as a design choice in, meant village protocol to encourage users to be more mindful of what they write.

<br />

#### Benefits of working with VeChain Services

* Great overall support from the Vechain team
* Increase in user adoption for VET tokens
* Lower Gas fee
* Faster transaction confirmation times
* And also rated as a 5 Star rated BlockChain service provider certified by the TUV Saarland
* VeChain’s focus on sustainability
* VeChain’s vision to build an ecosystem for eNFTs

* Tech Stack:
  * Node.JS
  * Next.JS
  * JavaScript
  * Rest API
  * My SQL
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc.
  #### Phase 1
    Initially, the Village Protocol platform will source the inputs from an auction and crowdfunding platform – Digital Village. These data will help setting up the Village Protocol platform to represent users' social interaction with the VeChain blockchain VIP-181 protocol. Whenever a user places a bid in auction or pledges in crowdfunding, that will update the resultant time-series graph. The graphs map community participation on every drop.

    The X-axis is the time of drop that secures the spot on the x-axis when the user views the graph. The Y is based on the current time. So the more number of auctioneers/pledgers, the higher the Y value. Y value keeps increasing as time goes on.

  #### Phase 2
    In the next phase, the Village Protocol will be made portable so that any third-party platform can show VeChain blockchain VIP-181 protocol interactions on their platform. 

    In order to get all NFTs of VIP-181, you need to have an indexed database where you save this data. Then you index all transfer events of VIP-181 contracts, eventually, calculate the balances for every address, and save this into a database where it's quickly accessible for every request. 

    It's a pretty cumbersome process, and unfortunately, nothing that is available. Our team is eager to help the VeChain team to make it possible. This is possible on other blockchain platforms like Ethereum. (Example, lazy.com). This has to do with the way data is structured in the blockchain, which just contains transactions and not actual indexed NFT data.
    
    ```
    // get all NFTs from Mainnet
    const allVeChainNFTs = await VP.Web3.getNFTs(from_date, to_date);
    ```
  
  ### Benefits
    - Effortless integration: Village Protocol is an extension of Web3.js. If you're already using Web3, then you can start using Village Protocol with a one-line change.
    - Enhanced Village Protocol APIs: The client exposes methods to call Village Protocol's exclusive features.
    - Automatic Retries: If Village Protocol returns a 429 response (rate limited), automatically retry after a short delay. This behavior is configurable.
    - Upgraded WebSockets: which don't miss events if the WebSocket needs to be reconnected.
    - Seamless provider handling: Most requests will be sent through Village Protocol backend, but requests involving signing and sending transactions are sent via a browser provider like VeChain Sync2 or Connex 2 if the user has it installed.


### Ecosystem Fit
* Our platform can help the VeChain ecosystem to launch their eNFTs and build communities around it using our Village Protocol, find utility for their assets in our metaverse, connect physical NFTs to digital NFTs, engage with the new generation and learn how their  customers are interacting with their digital products and services to develop sustainable physical supply chain  which can resonate with their customers. 
 
* Village protocol social graph helps businesses to connect with new gen more effectively
 
* We allow our users to interact with these companies in the metaverse and physical spaces connecting these two different worlds through their digital footprints powered by the social graph blockchain interface of our platform.
 
* Businesses developing on VeChain can add new revenue channels and explore new business models 
 
* Developers can build dapps on VeChain and connect it to the Village Protocol social graph

* Traditional companies can adapt Digital Village to gamify and better communicate their supply chain better to their customers by connecting it to Village Protocol
